# Getting Started with UI application

Once this repo is cloned successfully, follow below steps

1. Do `npm install` to install all packages
2. Make sure the server application is running
3. Edit .env file to update the url of Widgets api. If not, the url defaults to 'http://localhost:3000/widgets/'
4. Do `npm start`
5. Application starts at http://localhost:3001. If you wish to change the port, edit package.json file, line 23.

This starts the UI application and dashboard will be loaded.
